A project where to test stuff

So far I created a multi argument quick Rock Paper Scissors game which can be  run by running the jar with multiple arguments to choose among:
R/Rock, P/Paper, S/Scissors

Each choice represent a consecutive move in the game, therefore R R S P would stand by 4 consecutive games where the player choses rock, rock, scissors and then paper.
Each time the console will give us the result of the game that can be won, draw or lost.
